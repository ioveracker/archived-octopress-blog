This is the personal blog of Isaac Overacker. I write about development, design, and related topics here, generally with a focus on iOS. You can find me on Twitter as [@isaacoveracker](http://twitter.com/isaacoveracker) and GitHub as [ioveracker](http://github.com/ioveracker).

This blog is powered by the wonderful [Octopress](http://octopress.org) platform and hosted by [Heroku](http://heroku.com).  The theme is mnml, my own fork of [whiterspace](https://github.com/mjhea0/whiterspace) with a number of my own tweaks.  If you like it, you can get it [here](http://github.com/ioveracker/mnml).
