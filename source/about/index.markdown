##Hi, I'm Isaac Overacker.
I write about software development, design, and related topics here.  I generally focus on iOS and iPhone development.  You can find me on Twitter as [@ioveracker](http://twitter.com/ioveracker) and GitHub as [ioveracker](http://github.com/ioveracker).

I co-founded [Arboreal](http://arboreal.co) and developed [Listenlist](http://listenlist.co) for the iPhone.  It's a great way to keep track of the music you discover.  I'm also known to work on big enterprise software projects in the healthcare space using technologies like .NET and Oracle.  When I'm not hacking on something, I like to spend time with my wife, play video games, and brew beer.

This blog is powered by the wonderful [Octopress](http://octopress.org) platform and hosted by [Heroku](http://heroku.com).  The theme is [mnml](http://github.com/ioveracker/mnml), my own fork of [whiterspace](https://github.com/mjhea0/whiterspace) with a number of my own changes.  I write my posts in either [Mou](http://mouapp.com) or good old [vim](http://www.vim.org/) on OS X.
