##Hi, I'm Isaac Overacker.
I write about software development, design, and related topics here, generally with a focus on building apps for Apple platforms.  You can find me on Twitter as [@ioveracker](http://twitter.com/ioveracker) and GitHub as [ioveracker](http://github.com/ioveracker).

I build the iOS apps at [CBT Nuggets](http://www.cbtnuggets.com).  In the past, I co-founded [Arboreal](http://arboreal.co) and developed [Listenlist](http://listenlist.co) for the iPhone.  It's a great way to keep track of the music you discover.  I have also been known to work on big enterprise software projects in the healthcare space using technologies like .NET and Oracle.  When I'm not hacking on something, I like to spend time with my family, play tabletop (and occasionally video) games, and brew beer.

This blog is powered by the wonderful [Octopress](http://octopress.org) platform and hosted by [Heroku](http://heroku.com).  The theme is [mnml](http://github.com/ioveracker/mnml), my own fork of [whiterspace](https://github.com/mjhea0/whiterspace) with a number of my own changes.  I write my posts in either [Mou](http://mouapp.com) or good old [vim](http://www.vim.org/) on OS X.
