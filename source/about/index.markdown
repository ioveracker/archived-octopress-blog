This is the personal blog of Isaac Overacker.  I write about software development, design, and related topics with a focus on iOS.  You can find me on Twitter as [@isaacoveracker](http://twitter.com/isaacoveracker) and GitHub as [ioveracker](http://github.com/ioveracker).

I co-founded [Listn, LLC](http://listn.net) and developed [Listn](http://appstore.com/listn) for the iPhone.  I also write software in the healthcare informatics space.

This blog is powered by the wonderful [Octopress](http://octopress.org) platform and hosted by [Heroku](http://heroku.com).  The theme is [mnml](http://github.com/ioveracker/mnml), my own fork of [whiterspace](https://github.com/mjhea0/whiterspace) with a number of my own changes.  I write my posts in either [Mou](http://mouapp.com) or good old [vim](http://www.vim.org/) on OS X.
