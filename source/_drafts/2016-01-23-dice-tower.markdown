Over the years, I've dabbled in D&D, the Star Wars D20 RPG, Pathfinder, Magic: The Gathering (okay, that was far more than a dabble) and a few of the more popular Eurogames like Catan, Dominion, and Ticket to Ride. Lately, I've been spending a lot more time gaming in meatspace and have been voraciously exploring the current tabletop landscape with friends. There's nothing quite like gathering a group of friends and chucking some dice all night long, supplemented by copious amounts of beer. We even participated in [Extra Life](http://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donordrive.team&teamID=25243) this year, live-streaming nearly a full day of gaming on Twitch while asking friends to donate in support of our local Children's Miracle Network Hospital. It was a blast.

Sometimes, dice rolls would end up going off the table, or knocking over meeples, or turning into cat toys. To solve these problems, I decided to supplement my gaming experience with a dice tower. There are plenty of purchasable options out there, some of them quite beautiful, but the design is relatively simple. My father is an expert wood craftsman and has all of the required tools in his woodshop, so I have the perfect setup: free tools, free wood scraps, and expert help when needed.

I started by approximating the dimensions of the tower. A 4" x 4" x 8" rectangular shape seemed like a sensible place to start, with a similarly-sized tray at 1" depth for the dice. I modeled things in SketchUp to get a general feel for the external features.

I found a very nice scrap of solid cherry measuring 3/8" thick by 4 1/2" wide and around 8 feet in length.
